# Scripps-Spelling-Bee-Project
Using machine learning to predict spelling errors at the Scripps National Spelling Bee

I created this project as part of General Assembly's Data Science Part-Time course. 

The project relies on data from octonion's Spelling Repo as well as data collected from Merriam-Webster, Wiktionary, and etymonline.com.
